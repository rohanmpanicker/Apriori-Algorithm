# Apriori-Algorithm
This program successfully implements the Apriori Algorithm for inputted Minimum Support and Minimum Confidence values.

All you need to do is input the Minimum Support Percentage and Minimum Confidence Percentage. I've used the MySQL database to record the transactions.

It gives you ASSOCIATION RULES based on the inputs you provide.
